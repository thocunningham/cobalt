Cobalt allows for optional types, types where a value is either one of the
element type, or nothing. This is especially useful for pointers that may or
may not point to something. This feature is accompanied by a built-in constant
"none" indicating a non-existent value.

  var x: ?intptr = 0;
  var y: ?intptr = none;

Option values may be used in boolean conditions, such as if statements, ternary
expression, assertions, and more. Here of course, none equates to false, and any
other value to true.

  var x: ?intptr = ...;
  if (x) { ... } // this branch is taken if x is not none

More details concerning option types will follow.
